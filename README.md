# scrc-vis-analytical


This is a repository for the visual analytics prototypes built by the visualisation team. Each folder is a separate prototype either deriving new data for further analysis and visualisation and/or a prototype for visually analysing a collection of raw and derived data.

## How to include your contribution?

You can upload your analytical / visual analytics prototype by creating a folder under this repository. The protoypes can work with any language and on any part of the available data. Please make sure that you choose a short but descriptive name and include a short readme.md file to describe the protoype. If your code produced visuals, it would be great if you can embed a screenshot in the readme file so that we have a visual collection for those who want to quicky browse through what is being built. You can include build guidelines if needed. 

Below is a template to populate the README file under each folder
